Method Used to Load Data into Tables:

To load data into the tables, we used the INSERT statement. The statement inserts the desired values/data into the appropriate table columns. 
After we use the "INSERT INTO" statement, we provide the names of the columns. This lets us know what each value is supposed to represent. 
We follow that up with "VALUES" and the data that we are inserting into each respective column.

Contribution List: 

We met in person as a group to collectively work on the ER diagram and create a basic layout for what we wanted it to look like. 
The initial tables were also set up during our first meeting as well. It was just a matter of uploading the data and applying it to the queries. 
The three of us also met on Teams for a few hours at a time where we paired off at some point. 
Noor worked on finalizing the ER diagram/relationships and looking at documentation, while Nicole and Eduardo worked together to complete the queries we'd started.
Everyone was able to contribute in some way and we made sure to keep constant communication through Teams and our groupchat.
